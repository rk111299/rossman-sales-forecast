# rossman-sales-forecast

This coding project in r aims to show a pre-processing solution for historical sales data from the Rossman drug store chain in Germany. The overall business objective is to predict six weeks of daily sales for 1,115 drug stores, to improve profitabilty and increase customer satisfaction.
Techniques in this project included data transformation, dealing with missing values, dealing with outliers, data visualistaion, exploratory data anaylsis, feature selection and forecasting using a linear regression model. The main findings are that sales are highest over the christmas period and when store-specific promotions are on. 

Unfortuantely, the data used was too large to upload into this repository, but is widely available on the internet should anyone wish to run the R Studio Code.
